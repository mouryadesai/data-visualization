# data-visualization

This is a Python program that allows users to create pie, bar, and line charts based on their input. It uses the Matplotlib library to create the charts.

The program starts by asking the user to enter the number of items they want. It then loops through each item and asks the user to enter the data and label for each item. Once all the data and labels are entered, the program asks the user to select a chart type.

Based on the user's selection, the program calls the appropriate chart function to create the chart. After the chart is created, the program asks the user if they want to change the chart type. If the user selects "y" i.e 'yes', the program asks for a new chart type and creates the new chart. If the user selects "n" i.e 'no', the program ends.

Overall, this is a simple but effective program for creating charts.
